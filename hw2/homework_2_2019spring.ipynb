    "### 100 points [6% of your final grade]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due: Tuesday, February 26, 2019 by 11:59pm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Goals of this homework:* Understand word2vec-like term embeddings,  explore real-world challenges with SVM-based classifiers, understand and implement several evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission instructions (eCampus):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw2.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw2.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 2 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use as many late days as you like (up to the 5 total allotted to you).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",

    "*Example: I found helpful code on stackoverflow at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11764539/writing-fizzbuzz that helped me solve Problem 2.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

Additionally, this time, we also offer you the \"label\". If `label=1`, it means that this review is `Food-relevant`. If `label=0`, it means that this review is `Food-irrelevant`. Similarly, we have already done some basic preprocessing on the reviews, so you can just tokenize each review using whitespace.\n",
